# Welcome to the OctaGroove Github Reposistory


## What is OctaGroove
OctaGroove is a personal project I have created to create an enhanced UI dashboard for Spotify. It shows the users top 8 (hence octa) tracks, artists, and now trending genres. Its also gives recommendations, shows reccently played tracks, and currently playing tracks. No infor is stored on the site and it is free to users.

There is no backend in this app and no user data is stored or collected. Sessions are and auth for Spotify are handled by auth.js and only an encyrpted cookie is stored on the users browser. 

Access the app here:[https://octa-groove.vercel.app/](https://octa-groove.vercel.app)
